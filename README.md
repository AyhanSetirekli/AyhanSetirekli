## About Me ✨

👋 I'm currently working as a **Lead DevOps Engineer (AWS)** at Cognizant and have over 8 years of experience in the IT / Cloud Computing industry. My career is not just a job; it's my passion, purpose, and lifelong commitment.

📚 I believe in continuous learning and knowledge sharing (check out my [![DevTo](https://img.shields.io/badge/dev.to-black?style=flat&logo=devdotto&logoColor=white)](https://dev.to/ayhansetirekli)) to stay ahead in this dynamic/ever-changing field. I stay current with the latest cloud trends, best practices, and emerging technologies to deliver cutting-edge solutions.

🎓 I hold a Master's degree in Big Data & Text Analytics, where I excelled with a merit grade, harnessing the power of data processing and analytics to unlock insights in vast datasets.

🌍  My journey in the cloud industry began in 2018 when I joined Inawisdom with zero cloud experience. Through determination, dedication, and a thirst for knowledge, I transformed from a newcomer to a highly skilled individual in all things AWS, cloud architecture, and more.

💼 I've earned my stripes in cloud computing and infrastructure management (check out my [![Credly](https://img.shields.io/badge/Credly-white?style=flat&logo=credly)](https://www.credly.com/users/ayhan)), with a strong focus on AWS. My extensive AWS certifications, Terraform Associate, GitHub Actions, GitHub Foundations and Certified Kubernetes Administrator qualifications further validate my expertise/knowledge in deploying and managing cloud applications/infrastructures at scale. I have also recently begun my journey with GCP and have attained the Cloud Digital Leader Certification. 

🤝 Let's connect and explore how we can collaborate on cloud initiatives (connect with me on [![LinkedIn](https://img.shields.io/badge/LinkedIn-blue.svg?logo=linkedin&logoColor=white)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ayhansetirekli/)), share insights, and collectively shape the future of cloud engineering.
