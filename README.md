### Hi there 👋

👋 Hello. My name's Ayhan, and I'm a dedicated and passionate Lead Cloud Engineer with over 8 years of experience in the IT / Cloud Computing industry. My career is not just a job; it's my passion, purpose, and lifelong commitment.

📚 I believe in continuous learning and staying ahead in this dynamic/ever-changing field. I stay current with the latest cloud trends, best practices, and emerging technologies to deliver cutting-edge solutions.

🎓 I hold a Master's degree in Big Data & Text Analytics, where I excelled with a merit grade, harnessing the power of data processing and analytics to unlock insights in vast datasets.

🌍  My journey in the cloud industry began in 2018 when I joined Inawisdom with zero cloud experience. Through determination, dedication, and a thirst for knowledge, I transformed from a newcomer to a highly skilled individual in all things AWS, cloud architecture, and more.

💼 I've earned my stripes in cloud computing and infrastructure management, with a strong focus on AWS. My extensive AWS certifications (9 and counting), Terraform Associate, GitHub Actions, GitHub Foundations and Certified Kubernetes Administrator qualifications further validate my expertise/knowledge in deploying and managing cloud applications/infrastructures at scale using CI/CD and also underscores my commitment to staying at the forefront of a quickly changing industry. I have also recently begun my journey with GCP and have attained the Cloud Digital Leader Certification. 

🤝 Let's connect and explore how we can collaborate on cloud initiatives, share insights, and collectively shape the future of cloud engineering. My details can be found below:
